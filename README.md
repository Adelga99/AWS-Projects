<h1>This repo is specifically for documenting the projects I've done within AWS as I learn.
None of this was done professionally. I am a network administrator looking to expand my horizons into the cloud space for fun.</h1>

<h2>I am VERY new to using Git and GitHub, so forgive my documentation being lackluster. I will try to improve as time goes on.</h2>
